# Full binary tree
 - Binary tree where each node except leaf node has 2 children or 0 children

# Complete Binary tree
 - A tree whose nodes are filled from top to bottom and left to right

# Heaps

- Particular type of Binary Tree
- They are either Max Heaps or Min Heaps
- Min heaps are organized as having the minimum element as parent node down to just above the  leaf node
- Max heaps are organized as having the maximum element as parent node down to just above the leaf node

  Insertion - o(logn)
  Deletion - 0(logn)

  HeapSort - O(nlogn)

  Heapify -
  Min Heapify
  We start with the last sub tree from the right and check the node values, we sift the node value which has lowest value and sift it upwards and then iteratively move upwards and repeat the process upwards
